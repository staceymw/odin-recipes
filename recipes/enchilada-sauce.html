    <p>
      My favorite homemade enchilada sauce recipe is easy to make with pantry ingredients, it only requires about 5 minutes of prep time, and it tastes so flavorful and delicious.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
      <li>fine sea salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
       <strong>Cook the roux and spices:</strong> Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Add in the chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and oregano and cook for 1 more minute, whisking constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simmer:</strong> Gradually pour in the stock, whisking constantly to combine until no lumps remain.  Continue cooking until the sauce reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low to maintain the simmer (the sauce should continue lightly bubbling) for about 10-15 minutes, uncovered, until the sauce has slightly thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season:</strong> Give the sauce a taste and season with salt, as needed.  (I typically add 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, but the saltiness of the sauce can vary depending on the brand of stock that you use.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Use immediately in your favorite recipe and enjoy!
