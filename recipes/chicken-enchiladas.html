      <li>
        1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into small 1/2-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>
        1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles
      </li>
      <li>sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper</li>

        1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
      </li>
      <li>8 large flour tortillas</li>
      <li>3 cups Mexican-blend shredded cheese</li>
      <li>1 batch red enchilada sauce</li>

        optional toppings: fresh cilantro, chopped red onions, diced avocado, sour cream, and/or crumbled cotija cheese

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep oven and enchilada sauce.</strong> Preheat oven to 350°F.  Prepare your enchilada sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauté the filling mixture.</strong> In large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add diced chicken and green chiles, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.  Sauté the mixture for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through.  Add in the beans and stir until evenly combined.  Remove pan from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the enchiladas.</strong> To assemble the enchiladas, set up an assembly line including: tortillas, enchilada sauce, chicken mixture, and cheese. Lay out a tortilla, and spread two tablespoons of sauce over the surface of the tortilla.  Add a generous spoonful of the chicken mixture in a line down the center of the tortilla, then sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up tortilla and place in a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Assemble the remaining enchiladas.  Then spread any remaining sauce evenly over the top of the enchiladas, followed by any extra cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake.</strong> Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, until the enchiladas are cooked through and the tortillas are slightly crispy on the outside.  Transfer the baking dish to a wire baking rack.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Serve the enchiladas immediately while they're nice and hot and melty, garnished with lots of fresh toppings. Enjoy!</li>
